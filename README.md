### Project Motivation
This project Write a Data Science Blog Post is part of my deliverable of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project. Said data is located at the following address: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data

The project aims to answer the following business questions:
 - What are the months of greatest demand in the year?

- What is the type of rooms and how many of each?

- What is the average price per room type?

### Libraries
The libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Seaborn
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. Datetime
